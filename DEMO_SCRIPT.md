4. **Generate SHA-256 hash** - "Real-time hash generation: `a1b2c3d4...`"
5. **Show encryption** - "File encrypted before storage"

### **Step 2: Blockchain Logging (45 seconds)**
1. **Smart contract interaction** - "Storing hash on Ethereum blockchain"
2. **Show transaction** - "Gas fee: 0.02 ETH, Block: 18,456,789"
3. **Blockchain status** - "Live network information"
4. **Immutable record** - "Transaction hash: 0x123abc..."

### **Step 3: File Verification (45 seconds)**
1. **Retrieve file** - "Downloading from IPFS"
2. **Verify integrity** - "Comparing current hash with blockchain"
3. **Show success** - "‚úÖ File integrity verified"
4. **Audit trail** - "Complete history of file operations"

### **Step 4: Tampering Detection (60 seconds)**
1. **Generate tampered file** - "Simulating unauthorized modification"
2. **Attempt verification** - "Running integrity check"
3. **Show failure** - "‚ùå File has been tampered with!"
4. **Security alert** - "System detects unauthorized changes"

### **Step 5: Real-World Impact (30 seconds)**
1. **Use cases** - "Healthcare, Legal, Academic, Financial"
2. **Compliance** - "HIPAA, SOX, FERPA, PCI DSS ready"
3. **Benefits** - "Immutable, transparent, cost-effective"
